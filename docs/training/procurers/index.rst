Procurers Training
==================

Because of the limited time available, this training is presented as a
demonstration rather than a hands-on tutorial.  This demo covers three
topics:

#. User Management in Keycloak
#. Getting Usage Information
#. Adding Storage to Onedata

Further documentation can be found in the rest of the `platform
documentation <http://hn-docs.rtfd.io/>`_, particularly the
"Administrators" and "Data Coordinators" sections.
