Deploying on Nuvla
==================


.. _libcloud-deploy:

Deploying a base image
----------------------

- After logging into Nuvla open the `Centos-libcloud` application from the following link:

https://nuv.la/module/Training/Centos-libcloud

- Click on its Deploy button

- On the "Deploy Application Component" dialog you may optionally set the Tag field with comma separated values

Because we will later use it when presenting the :ref:`libcloud` feature, we may set the values to "libcloud, training"


Deploying a more complex application
------------------------------------

After log in to Nuvla, visit the URL where the component is defined :

https://nuv.la/module/apps/LAMP/lamp-deployment
