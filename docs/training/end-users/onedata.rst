Onedata
========


Managing Files via Web Interface
--------------------------------

All files in Onedata are organized in spaces. The Web User interface
allows for uploading and downloading files, creating access tokens,
managing access rights, sharing spaces, and joining other users'
spaces.


Login to Onezone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Onezone web interface is already deployed at
https://onezone.rhea-hn.com. You will use your standard federated
identity to log into the service, **not your student identity**.

Select Your Federated Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _access-token:

Create an Access Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This token will be needed when using access via OneClient (see
:ref:`posix`).


Select your storage provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Onedata enables access to federated storage resources via distributed
Oneprovider services, deployed close to actual storage resources in
order to enable efficient local access and replication when necessary
between the sites. Try to always to connect to the Oneprovider
instance, which hosts the data on the storage which is closest to
where the computation will be performed.

Navigate to your files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Press **Go to your files** button in the popup. The Oneprovider
hostname is displayed in the popup, along with the provider name and
storage quota dedicated to this space:

You will be redirected to the Oneprovider page, where the URL starts
with https://op-exo.hn.nuv.la.


Joining a space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A training space has been created. Go to the space menu and click on
the "Join" button.

You have been provided with an invitation Token to be copy/pasted here.

In order to upload a file, simply open the folder in which the file
should be placed and drag the file into the browser window:

Opening or downloading a file simply requires double clicking on the
file in the file window.

**Make sure that the popups for this browser window are not blocked,
and unblock them if necessary.**

From this Web interface you can create some directories and files.
Additionally, you may use the `Upload` button.

.. _posix:

Access Files on a VM via POSIX
------------------------------

Files can also be accessed directly via POSIX protocol on a Virtual
Machine.

.. _oneclient:


Deploying a OneClient application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After logging in to Nuvla, visit the URL where the component is
defined:
https://nuv.la/module/HNSciCloud/onedata/oneclient-ubuntu16.04.

It is setup a OneClient instance onto an Ubuntu system.

It is expecting four input parameters.

  .. figure:: ../../images/oneclient-params.png

     :width: 100%
     :align: center

1. access-token

Copy paste the Access Token you had created in OneZone (see
:ref:`access-token`)


2. mount point

It is the location where data coming coming from OneProvider spaces
will be mounted. You can keep the default

3. provider-hostname

This the Endpoint URL of your OneProvider instance Here we will set
the value: `op-exo.hn.nuv.la`.

4. Version: The OneClient version is set to a default value which we
   will not touch


 - Optionally set a tag value of your choice (e.g "training") in the
   Tags field

 - Hit the "Deploy Application Component" button


SSH Connection to the VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. From the Nuvla dashboard, wait for the OneClient deployment to be
   ready

#. Click on its Service URL column (the value starts with ssh://...)

   Assuming you added your SSH public key to your Nuvla profile (see
   :ref:`ssh`), you should be redirected to the Centos 7 VM as user
   ``root``.  The VM is already running an instance of Oneclient
   process to provide POSIX access to your data.

#. Browse the directory which was set as ``mount point`` parameter
   when :ref:`oneclient`

   If you haven't changed the default it should be::

     $ ls /mnt/onedata

   You should find a ``space-load`` folder which was provided by your
   Onezone administrator.

#. Read files from Oneclient::

       $ ls -lh /mnt/onedata/space-load/

   It should reflect the files you uploaded from the web interface.

#. Creating files from Oneclient

   Either::

       $ touch /mnt/onedata/space-load/somefile

   Or::

       $ echo Grenoble > /mnt/onedata/space-load/file.txt

   After refreshing your Oneprovider web page, you should see your new
   files in the web interface.
