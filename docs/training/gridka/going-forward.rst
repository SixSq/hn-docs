Going Forward
=============

In this training, you will learn how to deploy cloud applications with
Nuvla, a cloud application management platform, and how to deploy
virtual machines with the Exoscale cloud infrastructure.

If everything's gone well, you will have completed the following tasks
during the training:

 - Created an account on Exoscale,
 - Created an account on Nuvla,
 - Deployed virtual machines through the Exoscale web portal,
 - Deployed simple and complex cloud applications with Nuvla's browser
   interface,
 - Used Apache Libcloud to deploy virtual machines with Nuvla and
   Exoscale, and
 - Viewed the quantity of resources you have used to complete the
   training.

The accounts you have created are your own personal accounts, so you
are welcome to continue using them.

Going forward, you may want to look through the documentation for the
:ref:`platform-services`.  That documentation covers all the service
details. If you can't find the information you need, feel free to
