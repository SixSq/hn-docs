Administrators
==============

This section contains howtos for common tasks that will be carried out
by account administrators.

These account administrators are supposed to have followed the `Account Activation`_ steps, and already have been granted the *admin* privileges to their tenant/realm in `SixSq's Federated Identity Portal`_.

To access the account management portal in Keycloak, users need to select their tenant (same as realm) in `SixSq's Federated Identity Portal`_
