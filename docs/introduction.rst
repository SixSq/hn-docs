Introduction

Platform Features
-----------------

Ten of Europe’s leading public research organisations launched the
Helix Nebula Science Cloud (HNSciCloud) Pre-Commercial Procurement to
establish a European hybrid cloud platform that will support the
high-performance, data-intensive scientific use-cases of this “Buyers
Group” and of the research sector at large. It calls for the design
and implementation of hybrid innovative Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS) solutions for compute, storage, network connectivity, Federated
Identity Management and Service Payment Models, to augment & enhance
the science community’s existing systems.

The RHEA Group consortium’s HNSciCloud design builds on a solid
foundation of engineering expertise, existing open source software &
commercial services:

- RHEA System Engineering & Cyber Security expertise
- SixSq’s Nuvla, a SlipStream-based hybrid-cloud management service
  and Cyfronet’s OneData for Data Management
- Open Telekom Cloud, T-Systems’ IaaS Cloud Service (OpenStack)
- Exoscale IaaS Cloud Service (CloudStack)

The R&D innovations will be incorporated into these services as part
of our commercial offerings, with minimum intrusion into the buyers’
infrastructure, including:

- Peta-scale data management solution, portable to any cloud
- Flexible container management
- Single dashboard to better manage hybrid resources, including SLA
  compliance monitoring
- Unified accounting, integrating multi-cloud provider charges and
  billing
- Authentication from user to cloud providers

The Phase 1 design meets the buyers group’s needs using proven
technology and will be further refined and prototyped in
Phase 2. Phase 3 will demonstrate capabilities at scale with 20,000
cores, but even this could be only ~5% of the Buyers Group’s future
needs, so the technical solution, service delivery, business processes
and governance mechanisms must all be designed to scale by a factor
of 20. New procurement models will be developed providing public
sector organisations with flexible means to make multi-year
procurements of cloud-based services, taking full advantage of the
reliability, flexibility, scalability and increasingly competitive
pricing that can be offered by commercial providers.
