Exoscale Account
================

Exoscale_ provides the IaaS computing resources for the RHEA Cloud
Platform.  The Frankfurt and Geneva Exoscale regions are connected to
Géant and can provide high bandwidth to academic sites also connected
to Géant.  To use the platform, you must have an Exoscale account. 

Buyers Group Account
--------------------

The RHEA Consortium has already defined "organizations" within
Exoscale to allow the administrator of each Buyers Group tenant to
manage its users.  Contact your administrator directly to obtain an
account.  If you don't know your administrator, you can contact the
Support HelpDesk (`support@sixsq.com`_).
