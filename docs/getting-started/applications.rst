Components and Applications
===========================

The first place to look for interesting components (single virtual
machine services) and applications (multiple machine services) is the
`Nuvla App Store`_.

Within the Nuvla Workspace, there are other applications of interest:

 - ``examples/images``: Minimal distributions of common operating
   systems. Usually used as the basis for other components.
 - ``apps``: Curated list of applications that can be used as examples
   for your own applications.
 - ``HNSciCloud-RHEA/Benchmarking``: Both generic and
   HNSciCloud-specific benchmarks for evaluating the system.
 - ``HNSciCloud-RHEA/provisioning``: Modules for the Test Case 2.5.
 - ``HNSciCLoud-RHEA/s3-endpoint-tests``: Modules for Test Case 2.3.

Other application definitions will appear over time.  If you have
specific needs, contact SixSq support to request new ones.
