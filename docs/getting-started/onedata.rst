Onedata Account
===============

The Onedata_ services allow organizations and their users to manage
their data sets on the cloud.  These services are fully integrated
with the federated identity management services of HNSciCloud: eduGAIN
and Elixir AAI.  Onedata automatically creates an account if necessary
when logging in with your federated identity, so no explicit
registration is required.
