IMPORTANT - Scaling Guidelines
==============================

In the past, some scalability issues have been observed 
when provisioning big deployment through Nuvla.

While this issue is being worked on, technical users are
kindly asked to respect the following deployment guidelines 
in Nuvla.

Deploying Scalable Applications
-------------------------------

When deploying a scalable application, users should **not scale 
up or down by more than 100 VMs at the time**. Also, users 
should **keep the total number of VMs per application deployment 
under 300**.


Deploying Single Components
---------------------------

For single component deployment, **each user is able, for now, 
to deploy up to 500 instances**.
