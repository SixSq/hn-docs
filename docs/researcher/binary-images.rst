Binary VM Images
================

Uploading of binary VM images is strongly discouraged.  Use of the
Nuvla features for creating portable recipes (optionally with the
"build" feature) or the use of containers are preferred solutions.

Nonetheless, if you must use a binary VM image, you can upload the
image to OTC.  The documentation for making private images available
on OTC via the GUI is available from the OTC website:

 - `Uploading an External Image File
   <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/ims/en-us_topic_0030713183.html>`_
 - `Registering the Image File as a Private Image
   <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/ims/en-us_topic_0030713184.html>`_   
 - `Creating an ECS Using an Image
   <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/ims/en-us_topic_0030713200.html>`_ 

The API can also be used.  The documentation for this is:

 - `Uploading an Image via API
   <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/ims/en-us_topic_0031615566.html>`_ 
 - `Registering an Image File as a Private Image via API
   <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/ims/en-us_topic_0037131984.html>`_

You can then use this image directly from the OTC web browser
interface and the API.

Integration with Nuvla
----------------------

If you want to use this image from Nuvla, you must define it as a
"Native Image".

**TBD: Provide link and conditions to the standard documentation.**
