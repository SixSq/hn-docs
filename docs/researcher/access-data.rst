Data Access
===========

To facilitate a seamless access to the Buyers' distributed data sets, the
project uses `Onedata <https://onedata.org>`_ global data management system.

Onedata infrastructure, spanning multiple clouds, consists of two components -
Onezone and Oneprovider, and user level Oneclient tool for the data access.
Each Buyer Group has a single Onezone instance and per cloud instance of
Oneprovider.  Oneproviders attach to the Cloud's data stores and connect to
Onezone, with the latter being the main entry point and enabling the global
authentication and metadata management.

At this time, it is assumed that the distributed Onedata infrastructure is
already deployed by the Buyer's Group :ref:`data-coordinator` and the endpoints of
Onezone and Oneproviders are available.

Using Nuvla to provision data access client
-------------------------------------------

Users access their data on VMs using POSIX.  The data becomes available on the
VMs via mounting the required data sources with the help of `Oneclient tool
<https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/oneclient.html>`_.
When deploying VMs via `Nuvla <https://nuv.la>`_ service, users should use or,
when building their own components, inherit from `oneclient-<OS>` components,
which are available at https://nuv.la/module/HNSciCloud/onedata.

At the moment, for `oneclinet` to mount the data volumes on VMs and enable
POSIX access to the data, users need to provide it with a data access token and
the Cloud local Oneprovider endpoint.

Next versions of the platform will be extended to contain the auto-discovery of
the Cloud local Oneprovider as well as auto-generation of the data access
token.

Obtaining Onedata data Access Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are required to get the data access token

 * obtain the Buyer's Group Onezone endpoint
 * in Onezone, authenticate via FedIdP

.

 * when logged in Onezone web user interface, press `Access Tokens` in the top
   menu and press `Create new access token` button, then click on the `copy`
   pictogram

.. image:: images/dataaccess-gen-token.png
   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center

The copied data access token should be used with the **access-token** parameter
in the `oneclient` component deployment.

Obtaining Oneprovider endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check with your Data Manger for the IP/DNS name of the Oneprovider endpoint on
the Cloud of your choice.

Oneprovider IP can also be easily copied from the Onezone 'world' view by
clicking on the icon of selected Oneprovider instance and pressing `copy` button
in the top right corner of the popup:

Provision VM for data access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here it is explained on the example of CentOS 7 image.  Go to
https://nuv.la/module/HNSciCloud/onedata/oneclient-centos7 and click on
`Deploy`.

.. image:: images/oneclient-deploy.png

Select the Cloud on which you want to deploy the client via `Cloud` drop-down.
Provide **access-token** and **provider-hostname** parameters.   Optionally
change the default mount point of the spaces in **mount-point** parameter.
Then, click `Deploy Application Component` button.

Accessing data on VM
--------------------

After the successful deployment, user should expect the spaces (supported by
the selected provider) with the files available for POSIX access under
**mount-point**.  Example ::

    # ls -1 /mnt/onedata/
    space-s3
    space-gluster
    # ls -1 /mnt/onedata/space-s3
    test.txt
    #
