Virtual Private Network
=======================

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) makes sense in many cases where
you want to integrate cloud resources into your local services
seamlessly.  One such example would be extending a local batch cluster
with cloud resources.

To achieve that you may make use of the `private network`_ feature.
Exoscale provides an `example using OpenBSD`_, which can be ported to
other operating systems easily.
