Deploying Data Management Services
==================================

Data management service are based on Onedata technology. For general
overview of Onedata and it's core concepts including zones, providers
and spaces please refer to the `official documentation
<https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/getting_started/what_is_onedata.html>`_.

Onezone
-------

**Deploying Onezone via Nuvla**

Data managers are provided a possibility to automatically deploy Onezone
service for their Buyer Group via Nuvla.  The Onezone component definition can
be found under https://nuv.la/module/HNSciCloud-RHEA/onedata/onezone.  To
deploy Onezone component one needs to provide a number of input parameters to
properly configure the service.  The required parameters are related to the
connection of the Onezone with the project's Federated Identity Provider
(FedIdP) service located at https://fed-id.nuv.la.  It is assumed that the data
manager has access to the Buyer's Group realm in the FedIdP service (see `here
</getting-started/index>`) to obtain values for the following required Onezone
deployment parameters:

.
  * **hn-tenant-name** - Buyer tenant name, which should correspond to the
    realm name in FedIdP service;
  * **hn-fedid-token** - client registration token to register the deployed
    Onezone instance with FedIdP service.  The token should be generated by the
    data manager in FedIdP service right before attempting the deployment.
    This should be done the following way:

    1. Login to your realm on https://fed-id.nuv.la.
    2. Go to Realm Settings -> Client Registration -> Initial Access Tokens.

.
    3. Click on `Create`.
    4. Select defaults and click `Save`.
    5. Copy the generated token.
    6. Go to onezone deployment dialog and paste the token to
       **hn-fedid-token** edit field.

  * **onezone-version** - the default production version will be used if the
    value is not provided.

When parameters are set, click on *Deploy Application Component* button.  After
the successful deployment of Onezone, click on the URL defined by
``ss:url.service`` and you will be redirected to the running Onezone service.

On the front page of the Onezone you should see two login options.  For login
in to the deployed instance of Onezone you should select the second option
identified with the arrow on the image below - it uses FedIdP based
authentication.

In the case above, the configuration of the integration between Onezone and
project's FedIdP (https://fed-id.nuv.la) was done automatically.  More
information on setting up of various IdPs with Onezone can be found in the
Onedata's `official documentation
<https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/administering_onedata/openid_configuration.html>`_.

Oneprovider
-----------

**S3 Oneprovider on cloud via Nuvla**

After deploying Oneprovider VM via Nuvla, it is necessary to add an S3
storage to the Oneprovider using Onepanel administration service,
running on the same host as Oneprovider. In order to open Onepanel
service go to: ``https://ONEPROVIDER_IP:9443`` and login using
administrator credentials.

.. image:: images/onepanel-admin-login.png

After login, go to **Storages** tab and press **Add storage**
button. Depending on whether the S3 bucket is on Exoscale or OTC,
different configuration options must be specified:

- **Exoscale**

- **OBS**

**GlusterFS Oneprovider on cloud via Nuvla**

.. image:: images/gluster-storage.png

**Oneprovider in BG organization via Nuvla**

TODO

**Oneprovider in BG organization manually**

When deploying Oneprovider on custom storage resources it is necessary
to add the storage using Onepanel administrative interface.

Currently the following storage backends are supported:

- POSIX (this includes any storage which can be mounted to Oneprovider
  VM such as Lustre or NFS)

- GlusterFS

- S3

- Ceph

- Openstack Swift

Each of the storage types requires different parameters to be
configured properly, which can be found in the `official documentation
<https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/administering_onedata/storage_configuration.html>`_.

Managing Spaces
---------------

Space can be seen as a virtual directory, which contents are stored on
distributed storage resources provisioned by storage providers. Each
space must have at least one provider supporting it with a non-zero
storage space (quota). The effective quota available to a single space
is the sum of storage quotas dedicated to this space by all storage
providers supporting it.

Creating spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spaces in Onedata can be seen as virtual volumes or buckets, where an arbitrary
directory and file hierarchy can be created.

To create a new data space follow these steps:

- In the Onezone Web Interface unfold Data space management tab
  located on the left menubar

.. image:: images/spacestabhome.png
   :scale: 50 %

- Click Create new space button

- Provide new space name in the text edit field and confirm

New space will appear in the list of spaces designated with a unique ID.

Supporting spaces with Oneprovider instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default new space has no storage resources associated with it. In
order to add storage quota to a space, generate a space support token
by clicking on `Get support` option under space name, copy the
presented token and send the token to the administrator of the
Oneprovider instance whose the storage resources should be assigned to
this space.
