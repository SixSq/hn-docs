Deploying Data Management Services
==================================

Data management services are based on Onedata technology. For general
overview of Onedata and it's core concepts including zones, providers
and spaces please refer to the `official documentation
<https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/getting_started/what_is_onedata.html>`_.

Information on deploying these services is available from CYFRONET. If
you need to do this, you can contact them through the Consortium's
HelpDesk (support@sixsq.com) or directly.
